# Database tutorial
- database files are at the path: `C:\xampp\mysql\data\*`
- but to export it, open the database in XAMPP and use "Export" to export as a .sql file (or, ".sql.zip")
- in the new location (in a different computer) create a new database, and use "Import" and select the .sql file or the .sql.zip to import the database files.

# Future Additions
- Consistent reminder of services: Accepted / Offered sevices will be reminded throughout the website using a popup bar on the screen
- Add location to service creation. Add "Agreements" to services and make minimum payments (neglegible amount) mandatory to reduce spam.
- AI Chat
- CSS improvements
- Javascript improvements. PHP to Laravel/Node.js/Django Backend, and MySQL to MongoDB Database.
